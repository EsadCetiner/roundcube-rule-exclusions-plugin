# Plugin name: roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin
# Plugin description: OWASP CRS 3rd party plugin for Roundcube webmail
# Rule ID block base: 9,519,000 - 9,519,999
# Plugin version: 1.0.3

# See readme.md for documentation

# Generic rule to disable the plugin
#
# Plugins are enabled by default.
#
# They become active by placing them in the plugin folder. It is possible to
# control plugin activation via setting a variable. This can be done in the
# plugin config file here.
#
# The predefined variable name is meant to be "<plugin name>-plugin_enabled".
# For the roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin, this means it can be disabled by setting
# roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin=0
#
# Note that a global setting of this variable overrides the setting here.
# That means the "enabled" variable is only set by this rule if it has not
# been set before.
#
# Feel free to set the variable unconditionally here by replacing the
# SecRule line with an unconditional SecAction statement.
#
# Uncomment to disable this plugin
#
# SecRule &TX:roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin "@eq 0" \
#    "id:9519000,\
#    phase:1,\
#    pass,\
#    nolog,\
#    ver:'roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin/1.0.3',\
#    setvar:'tx.roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin=0'"
#
# Since Roundcube sends all requests to the same URL path (Depending on your HTTP server configuration),
# by default this plugin will unconditionally apply all rule exclusions to all URL paths.
# You can optionally configure what URL path this plugins will run under by modifying the rule below:
# SecRule &TX:roundcube-rule-exclusions-path "@eq 0" \
#     "id:9519001,\
#     phase:1,\
#     pass,\
#     nolog,\
#     ver:'roundcube-rule-exclusions-plugin/1.0.3',\
#     setvar:'tx.roundcube-rule-exclusions-path=/'"
